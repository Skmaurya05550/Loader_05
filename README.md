# Wave Loading Animation

This is a simple web-based wave loading animation created using HTML and CSS. The animation consists of five dots that move in a wave-like pattern.

## Files

- `index.html` - The main HTML file that includes the structure of the animation.
- `styles.css` - The CSS file that defines the styles and animations for the wave loading effect.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
3. The wave loading animation will appear on the screen.

## Customization

- You can adjust the width, height, and background color of the wave dots by modifying the CSS properties in `styles.css`.
- The animation duration can be controlled via the `animation` property under the `.wave-dot` class.
